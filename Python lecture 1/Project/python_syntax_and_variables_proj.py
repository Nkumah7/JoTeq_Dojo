Suppose you are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to
medical insurance costs. Using a formula that estimates a person's yearly insurance costs,
you will investigate how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction 

"""


# 1. Create variables for each factor we will consider when estimating medical insurance costs
# age, sex(0, 1), bmi (body mass index), num_of_children, smoker (0, 1)
# create the initial variables below
# age = 28
# sex = 0
# bmi = 26.2
# num_of_children = 3
# smoker = 0


# Add insurance estimate formula below
# insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500


# 2. Create variable to calculate insurance cost 


# 3. Display insurance cost


# 4. Add age to 'age' variable


# 5. Recalculate insurance cost


# 6. Find differnce between new and old insurance cost


# 7. Display new information


# 8. Use BMI factor to calulate
# Reset age to first age
# Add to bmi factor (3.1)

# 9. Evaluate the change in insurance cost with regards to bmi and display result


# 10. Looking at gender factor
# Reassign the bmi to initial bmi
# Assign sex to 1



# Evaluate insurance soct with regards to gender and display result
